# adapt-component-pageJumper
text component with a button that jumps you to a different page



this component was derived from adaptlearning's text component which can be found here: https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-text



the difference is the addition of a button which allows navigation to a different page within the course

##Button Positioning

choose one of these positions for the button in the properties: left (default), center, right



## Limitations

the jump-to page will replace the current page in the history. it is recommended to jump to pages only within the same submenu for a fluid user experience.
