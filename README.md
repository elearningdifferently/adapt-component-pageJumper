# adapt-component-pageJumper
text component with a button that jumps you to a different page



this component was derived from adaptlearning's text component which can be found here: https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-text



the difference is the addition of a button which allows navigation to a different page within the course



#button positioning

change this style in .jumpnav to position the button, default is left:
text-align: left;
text-align: center;
text-align: right;



## Limitations

it is recommended to jump to pages only within the same submenu due to the default behavior of the navigation's back button.
