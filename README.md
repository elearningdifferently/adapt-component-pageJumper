# adapt-component-pageJumper
text component with a button that jumps you to a different page

--

this component was derived from the text component which can be found here: https://github.com/adaptlearning/adapt-contrib-text

--

the difference is the addition of a button which allows navigation to a different page within the course.

## Limitations

it is recommended to jump to pages only within the same submenu due to the default behavior of the navigation's back button.
